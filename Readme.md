# Pop LegalServer Notes


Introduce two `html`-formatted Instruction blocks into a Case Profile, and your users can pin important case notes by adding the token, _#POP!_ to the note.

Notes with the special token will pop from the regular collection of case notes into the first instruction. If you placed the first instruction at the top of the Case profile, then the 'Popped' notes will appear at the top of the Case Profile.

Simply edit the note to remove _#POP!_ to restore the note to its original place. 

See index.html for a working example of the code.
